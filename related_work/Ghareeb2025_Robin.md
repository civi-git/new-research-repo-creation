## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite advances in AI for individual research tasks, no system had automated all stages in a single, integrated workflow.

### Prior Work Assumptions
- Individual components of scientific discovery could be automated separately
- Full integration across research stages was not technologically feasible
- Human oversight and intuition were necessary for meaningful scientific insights
- Literature search and experimental design required separate, specialized approaches

### Key Insight
Multi-agent architecture integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents can achieve semi-autonomous scientific discovery by orchestrating specialized AI capabilities in a coordinated workflow, enabling end-to-end research automation.

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Multi-agent system with specialized agents:
  - **Crow**: Literature search and synthesis
  - **Falcon**: Molecular evaluation and candidate assessment
  - **Finch**: Complex data analysis and interpretation
- **Coordination**: Workflow orchestration enabling iterative hypothesis-experiment-analysis cycles
- **Application Domain**: Drug repurposing for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD)
- **Integration**: Lab-in-the-loop framework combining AI decision-making with human experimental execution

### Experimental Validation
- **Discovery**: Identified ripasudil (ROCK inhibitor) as novel dAMD therapeutic candidate
- **Process**: 
  1. Initial hypothesis: Enhance retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis
  2. Candidate screening: Tested 10 compounds, identified Y-27632
  3. Mechanism investigation: RNA-seq revealed ABCA1 upregulation
  4. Novel discovery: Ripasudil identified as superior candidate
- **Validation**: All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and figures were AI-generated
- **Outcome**: Preclinical validation of previously unknown therapeutic approach

### Impact and Significance
- **First achievement**: End-to-end AI-driven scientific discovery with real-world experimental validation
- **Paradigm shift**: Demonstrates feasibility of AI systems as scientific collaborators rather than tools
- **Discovery value**: Novel therapeutic candidate for major cause of blindness
- **Methodological contribution**: Template for multi-agent scientific research automation

## Key Assumptions Identified
1. **Modular decomposition**: Scientific discovery can be broken into specialized, coordinated sub-processes
2. **Agent specialization**: Different research tasks benefit from dedicated agent architectures
3. **Human-AI collaboration**: Optimal workflow involves AI intellectual work + human experimental execution
4. **Literature-driven discovery**: Comprehensive literature synthesis can guide novel hypothesis generation
5. **Iterative refinement**: Scientific insights emerge through systematic hypothesis-testing cycles

## Potential Limitations
- Relies on human execution of physical experiments
- Success demonstrated primarily in drug repurposing (lower-risk discovery)
- May be biased toward incremental rather than paradigm-shifting discoveries
- Limited evaluation of failure modes or systematic biases

## Research Connections
- Builds on specialized AI tools for literature search and data analysis
- Extends single-agent approaches to multi-agent coordination
- Complements AI Scientist work focused on computational research domains
- Connects to broader trend toward agentic AI systems in scientific domains

## Future Research Directions
- Full automation including robotic experimental execution
- Application to fundamental rather than applied research questions
- Cross-domain discovery connecting multiple scientific fields
- Integration with assumption-challenging rather than evidence-synthesis approaches
